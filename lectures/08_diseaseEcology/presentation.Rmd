# Parasite, pathogen, infection, and disease

.font200[.red[parasite]: an organism that lives in or on another organism (.green[host]) and causes .blue[harmful] effects as it consumes resources from the host.]   .font150[(consumer-resource)]

--

.font200[When parasites colonize a host, that host is said to harbor an .red[infection]]

--

.font200[Only if that infection gives rise to symptoms that are clearly harmful to the host should the host be said to have a .red[disease], e.g., COVID-19]

--

.font200[.red[Pathogen]: any parasite that causes a disease (i.e. is ‘pathogenic’), e.g., SARS-CoV-2]


???

though infection by a pathogen does not always result in an infectious disease; asymptomatic

# Parasites are diverse

### Pretty much every organism of living thing has one or more parasite, including parasites (_hyperparasite_)

--

### Many parasites are host-specified or at least have a limited range of hosts (_specialists_); few has a broad range of hosts (_generalists_)

--

### The conclusion seems _unavoidable_ that .red[more than 50%] of the species on the earth, and many more than 50% of individuals, are parasites

# Effects of parasites

### Large toll on people: >25% human deaths are caused by infectious disease; 100 million people died in 1918 (spanish flu caused by H1N1 virus); >2 million deaths caused by COVID-19 so far

### On wildlife: bird flu; chytrid fugus caused extinctions of amphibian species; white-nose syndrome for bats

### On plants: crops (e.g., wheat rust), trees (e.g., chestnut blight, dutch elm disease)

???

american chestnut trees used to be >50% of trees in temperate forests; now they are rare since the introduce of chestnut blight around 1900 from Asian

# Types of parasites

.font130[
- By location 
  + .blue[ectoparasites]: live on the outside of organisms (e.g., ticks, mites, lice, fleas, mistletoes) 
  + .blue[endoparasites]: live inside organisms (e.g., virus, cestode), often cause diseases
]

--

.font130[
- By size
  + .blue[microparasites]: small and often intra-cellular, reproduce directly within host and are often extremely numerous (e.g., virus, some types of bacteria and protists)
  + .blue[macroparasites]: larger, live on or within a host (in cavities such as the gut or inter-cellular), do not reproduce in their host (e.g., helminth worms in an intestine, some types of fungi, bacteria and protozoa)
]

--

.font130[
- By transmission mode
  + .blue[horizontal]: move between individuals other than parents and offsprings
  + .blue[vertical]: transmitted from a parent to its offspring
]

???

tradeoffs: exposure to natural enemies, external envi, difficulty to move among host, ease of feeding on hosts

# The parasite niche

### Multidimensional space of tolerances and requirements of a species (abiotic and biotic)

### Niche --> understand and predict geographic distribution

### Niche --> understand host range and predict host switching; _spillover_ if the host switching involves the ability to infect a human host

.font130[
- Spanish flu in 1918 (H1N1 virus from birds)
- HIV (virus from chimpanzees)
- SARS in 2003 (SARS-CoV from bats?)
- COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 from ?)

# Hosts as habitats

.font130[Hosts as reactive environments: resistance, tolerance, recovery, and immunity]

Chimpanzees infected with nematodes seek out and eat a bitter plant that contains chemicals that kill or paralyze the nematodes
