# Stucture of `niche` class


## What is the niche? (**think-pair-share**)

the set of environments a species is found in? We'll see what they say and work from there.










## How has the niche historically been defined?

Grinnell = "the geographic range or set of habitats that a species occupies"

Elton = "the environments a species occupies as determined by food resources and natural enemies"

Hutchinson = "an n-dimensional hypervolume outside of which a species cannot persist"
- the most mathematically rigorous
- sets up persistence as a necessity
- asserts that the niche is not a geographic construct, but an environmental one
- largely removes the influence of natural enemies (more of a focus on abiotic tolerances)



**This is still an ongoing "thing", as you'll see in the readings for this week**








## Species physiological tolerance curves

Link this to the idea of the niche. The units are different, but the idea is conceptually nearly the same. Also, try to link back to the ideas from population growth. Persistence basically means a long run population growth r > 0. 




I will present the niche as a persistence boundary. This is different than how some would teach this. Some might teach the niche as a probability surface (go into this a bit). It can be thought of as either. I just like the persistence boundary idea. There's some nuance here when we talk about how the niche is quantified in practice.






### On what biological level of organization is the niche defined?

- Open up for discussion. I normally think of the niche as a property of the species. Others have argued that it's a property of the individual, but that we just can't estimate it for every individual. For the purposes of the class, we'll treat the niche as a species-level property. Discuss how individual-level niches would build up to the species-level niche. 
((do we take the mean value of the species lines, or the extreme?))












## Linking the niche in environmental space to the niche in geographic space

This is an important distinction. Take your time with this and be very very clear. Niches are defined in environmental space. Niches can be projected into geographic space. 


**Go through a worked example of this**












## Fundamental and realized niches

Fundamental niches represent all the environmental conditions where a species is able to live

Realized niche is where the species actually lives


Fundamental niche is typically larger than the realized. Why?
+ dispersal limitation
+ predators
+ parasites


However, there are also weird cases where the realized niche can be larger than the fundamental. Can we think of examples where this could happen?
+ facilitation (dune grasses as an example)
+ microhabitat variation (this gets a bit at the issue of scale when defining the niche; e.g., a small oasis in the middle of the desert)

## Niche overlap and competitive exclusion

Niche overlap is the extent that one species ecological niche overlaps with another species. That is, how similar are the abiotic limitations of two species? Two species with similar abiotic tolerances will be found in the same environments, and are more likely to compete more strongly. 

The competitive exclusion principle states that if two species with identical niches (i.e., ecological roles) compete, then one will inevitably drive the other to extinction. This is a bit tenuous, and we'll discuss this more in the competition lectures, but it's not just that two species need to have high niche overlap, but they need to compete for a limiting resource. So if we define the niche to include food resources, then niche overlap might start to get at the strength of competition. Just know that some people think that greater niche overlap means stronger competition. 















## Niche evolution

Selective pressures as well as genetic drift can change niche limits of a species. This is especially important as shifting climates could potentially displace species. In this case, where the climate in a given location is shifting outside of a species niche limits, species can either 1) disperse and track their favorable environment, 2) adapt abiotic tolerances to current conditions or 3) die.

But niche evolution can occur in a static environment as well. This can happen through competition. 

**Niche partitioning**: The process by which natural selection drives competing species into different patterns of resource use or different niches. Coexistence is obtained through the differentiation of their realized ecological niches.


**Spatial niche partitioning**: As an example of niche partitioning, several anole lizards in the Caribbean islands share common food needs - mainly insects. They avoid competition by occupying different physical locations. Although these reptiles might occupy different locations, you may also find groups living around the same area, in which can contain up to as many as fifteen different lizards. For example, some live on the leaf litter floor while others live on branches. Species who live in different areas compete less for food and other resources, which minimizes competition between species.

**Temporal niche partitioning**: Occurs when species differ in their competitive abilities based on varying environmental conditions. For example, in the Sonoran Desert, some annual plants are more successful during wet years, while others are more successful during dry years.
